#### Customization Tips:

* **Screenshots:** Embed example images of the UI—especially mobile vs. desktop views.
* **Badges:** Consider badges for build status, license, version, or Vercel deployment.
* **API Info:** If the backend integrates with a specific news API or requires env variables (e.g., `NEWS_API_KEY`), include a setup snippet:

  ```env
  API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  PORT=5000
  ```

Let me know if you'd like help tailoring any section further—like adding badges, explaining environment variables, or elaborating on features!
